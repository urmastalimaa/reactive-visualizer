## Purpose
The *simulation controller* allows setting the internal clock of the `Observable` simulation.

## Controlling the clock

There are two possible ways to control the internal clock of the `Observable`.

### ***Play***
  The *Play* button simulates the observable in pseudo-real-time.

### **Slider**
The *slider* allows setting the internal clock of the `Observable` simulation to a specific time.
