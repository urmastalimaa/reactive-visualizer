## Purpose
The Observable editor provides a JavaScript editor for creating an Observable.
The building blocks for creating an Observable are factories and operators.

## Factory
An Observable if created by specifying a factory, which produces the initial values.  
A list of factories is provided in the drop-down next to `Rx.Observable.`.

The simplest Observable consists of a single factory:
```js
  Rx.Observable.just(5)
```

## Operators
An Observable can be transformed by applying an operator to it.
An Observable of 5 values every 500ms is created with:
```js
  Rx.Observable.interval(500)
    .take(5)
```

A list of operators is provided in the drop-down which opens when hovering over the `+` symbol.  
The `+` symbol is located next to existing factories and operators.  

An operator can be removed by clicking on the `-` symbol.

## Arguments

The arguments for any building block can be provided by as a JavaScript expression.  
There is always a default expression provided.  
When making changes, the return type of the expression must remain same.

### Nested Observables

Some building blocks can have arguments which themselves are Observables.  
In that case a nested Observable editor is created.
