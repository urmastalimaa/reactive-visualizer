## Purpose
The *virtual time controller* allows setting the internal clock of the *Observable*.

## Controlling the clock

There are two ways to control the internal clock of the *Observable*.

### ***Play***
The *Play* button simulates the observable in pseudo-real-time.

### **Slider**
The *slider* allows setting the internal clock of the *Observable* simulation to a specific time.
