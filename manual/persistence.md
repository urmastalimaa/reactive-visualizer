## Purpose

*Persitence* controls allow saving and loading example *Observables* using the *Load* and *Save* buttons.

### ***Load***

Clicking on the *Load* button opens a modal with the following panels.

#### ***Bundled examples***

*Bundled examples* are examples which are bundled with the *Reactive Visualizer* and cannot be changed.  

#### ***User examples***

*User examples* contain examples saved by the user.  

#### **Loading an example**

Every example is described by its name, which appears on the left side,  
and a short description which appears on the right.  

To load any example, click on it's name.  

To delete an example, click on the small red `x` button on the right side of the example.

### ***Save***

The *Save* button stores the current *Observable* in *User examples*.  
When clicked, two mandatory inputs are presented:
1. *Name*,
2. *Description*.

These values will appear correspondingly in *User examples*.
