### Purpose

Persitence controls allow saving and loading example Observables using the *Load* and *Save* buttons.

#### Loading

Clicking on the *Load* button opens a modal with the following panels.

##### Bundled examples

Bundled examples are examples which are bundled with the Reactive Visualizer and cannot be changed.  

##### User examples

User examples contain examples saved by the user.  

##### Loading an example

Every example is described by its name, which appears on the left side,  
and a short description which appears on the right.  

To load any example, click on it's name.  

To delete an example, click on the small red `x` button on the right side of the example.

#### Saving an example

The *Save* button stores the current Observable in User examples.  
When clicked, two mandatory inputs are presented:
1. *Name*,
2. *Description*.

These values will appear correspondingly in User examples.
